# Code of Conduct - k8s-automated-dr

## Our Commitment

The k8s-automated-dr project is committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for all contributors, regardless of experience level, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

As a DevOps and infrastructure-focused project dealing with critical disaster recovery systems, we value professionalism, technical excellence, and collaborative problem-solving.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behavior

Contributors to k8s-automated-dr are expected to:

- **Share knowledge constructively** - Help others learn Kubernetes, disaster recovery concepts, and automation best practices
- **Provide thorough documentation** - Write clear commit messages, comprehensive PR descriptions, and maintain accurate documentation
- **Test rigorously** - Ensure code changes don't compromise disaster recovery capabilities; include appropriate tests
- **Review code professionally** - Provide constructive feedback focused on code quality, security, and reliability
- **Respect operational concerns** - Understand that DR systems are mission-critical; prioritize stability and reliability
- **Collaborate openly** - Share insights about infrastructure challenges, deployment strategies, and operational experiences
- **Be patient with newcomers** - Help those learning Kubernetes, automation tools, or disaster recovery concepts

### Technical Standards

Given the critical nature of disaster recovery systems:

- **Security first** - Report security vulnerabilities privately; don't commit sensitive configuration data
- **Production awareness** - Consider the operational impact of changes on production environments
- **Documentation quality** - Maintain clear setup instructions, troubleshooting guides, and operational runbooks
- **Code quality** - Follow infrastructure-as-code best practices, use appropriate linting, and maintain clean Git history
- **Testing requirements** - Include unit tests, integration tests, and disaster recovery validation where applicable

### Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated:

- **Technical gatekeeping** - Dismissing contributions based on technology preferences rather than technical merit
- **Operational negligence** - Introducing changes that could compromise disaster recovery capabilities without proper review
- **Security violations** - Sharing sensitive credentials, exposing internal infrastructure details, or ignoring security protocols
- **Harassment or discrimination** - Any form of harassment, personal attacks, or discriminatory behavior
- **Disruptive behavior** - Trolling, spam, or deliberately derailing technical discussions

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- All repository interactions (issues, PRs, discussions, wikis)
- Project-related communication channels
- Conference talks or presentations about the project
- Social media posts when representing the project
- Any community events or meetups related to the project

## Enforcement

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by:

- Creating a private issue in the repository (if appropriate)
- Contacting project maintainers directly
- Using GitHub's reporting features for serious violations

All reports will be handled confidentially and investigated promptly.

### Consequences

Project maintainers may take the following actions for Code of Conduct violations:

1. **Warning** - Private conversation about the violation and expected behavior changes
2. **Temporary suspension** - Temporary loss of interaction privileges in project spaces
3. **Permanent ban** - Permanent removal from all project interactions and spaces

### Appeal Process

Contributors who disagree with enforcement actions may appeal by:

- Contacting project maintainers with additional context
- Providing evidence that the violation report was inaccurate
- Demonstrating changed behavior and commitment to the Code of Conduct

## Technical Communication Guidelines

Given the technical nature of disaster recovery systems:

- **Be precise** - Use accurate technical terminology; clarify abbreviations and acronyms
- **Include context** - Provide relevant system information, error messages, and configuration details
- **Show your work** - Include steps to reproduce issues, testing performed, and validation methods
- **Consider impact** - Discuss potential effects on backup schedules, RTO/RPO metrics, and operational procedures
- **Document decisions** - Explain the rationale behind architectural choices and trade-offs

## Recognition

We recognize that disaster recovery is a complex domain requiring expertise across multiple areas including Kubernetes, storage systems, networking, monitoring, and operational procedures. We value contributions from:

- Platform engineers and SREs
- DevOps practitioners
- Kubernetes administrators
- Backup and recovery specialists
- Documentation writers and technical writers
- Security professionals
- Anyone helping improve system reliability

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, and tailored for infrastructure and DevOps projects.
